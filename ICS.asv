function I = ICS(A)
%ICS computes the adjacency matrix from time series data.
%   The edges of the adjacency matrix consist of the pearson correlation coefficients between the
%   time series of the nodes in TimeSeries.
%%% INPUT %%%
% TimeSeries: n x m time series matrix, with n the number of time points and m the number of nodes.
%%% OUTPUT %%%
% A: m x m adjacency matrix
A = corr(TimeSeries);
